# Guess-My-Number

The Guess My Number game is a fun interactive project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 20, and the player has to guess it.

- The player enters a number and clicks the "Check" button to see if the guess is correct.

- If the guess is too high or too low, the game provides hints, and the current score decreases by 1 with each wrong attempt.

- If the guess is correct, the player wins the game, and the score at that point is saved as the highest score if itâ€™s greater than the previous one.

- The game also allows the player to reset and play again while keeping track of the highest score.

This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript, along with a simple and engaging UI styled using CSS.
